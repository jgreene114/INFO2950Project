    "Introduction: The introduction should be the exposition of the article where you can use less rigorous language. Your language should be generally accessible. Aim for this to be readable by someone who hasn't taken this class (maybe your roommate, your family, or you at the start of the semester). It should still be formal, but someone should come to the end and want to read more. 538 articles might be a good baseline tone for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced introductions will immediately tell us what the setting is, what you found, and why it matters. They will add details as they are needed. Language will be polished and free from errors (Note: if your group does not include a native English speaker, make a note of that). Beginning writeups will be less focused and organized. They may jump to technical details without explaining why results are important. They may have spelling and grammatical errors, or awkward or incomplete sentences, indicating that they were written in haste and never reviewed.\n",

    "    Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n",
    "    What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?\n",
    "    What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n",
    "    If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?\n",

    "# Interpretation and conclusions.\n",
    "What did you find over the course of your data analysis, and how confident are you in these conclusions? Detail your results more than you did in the introduction, now that the reader is familiar with your methods and analysis. Interpret these results in the wider context of the real-life application from where your data hails.\n",

    "Provide a link to your Github repository (or other file hosting site) that has all of your project code beyond what's in the notebook itself (if applicable). For example, you might include web scraping code or data filtering and aggregation code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Acknowledgments.\n",
    "Recognize any people or online resources that you found helpful. These can be tutorials, software packages, Stack Overflow questions, peers, and data sources. Showing gratitude is a great way to feel happier! But it also has the nice side-effect of reassuring us that you're not passing off someone else's work as your own. Crossover with other courses is permitted and encouraged, but it must be clearly stated, and it must be obvious what parts were and were not done for 2950. Copying without attribution robs you of the chance to learn, and wastes our time investigating.\n",

The data cleaning description should be a separate Jupyter notebook with executed cells, and it should output the dataset you submit as part of your project (e.g. written as a .csv file).\n",

    "## (Optional) Other appendices.\n",
    "You will almost certainly feel that you have done a lot of work that didn't end up in the final report. We want you to edit and focus, but we also want to make sure that there's a place for work that didn't work out or that didn't fit in the final presentation. You may include any analyses you tried but were tangential to the final direction of your main report. Graders may briefly look at these appendices, but they also may not. You want to make your final report interesting enough that the graders don't feel the need to look at other things you tried. \"Interesting\" doesn't necessarily mean that the results in your final report were all statistically significant; it could be that your results were not significant but you were able to interpret them in an interesting and informed way.\n",
